Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this,
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
