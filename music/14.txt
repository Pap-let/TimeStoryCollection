Where is your love
Your love is gone
I can not find it anymore
Where is your soul
Your soul is gone
I can not find it anymore
Where is my country
My country is gone
I can not find it anymore
Where is the light
The light in your eyes
Why are your rivers covered with ice
Your soul is covered with ice
Where is your love
Your love is gone
I can not find it anymore
Where is my country
My country is gone
I can not find it anymore
Bankers and Robbers
Are partners in crime
Politicians
Lying all the time
