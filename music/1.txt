Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Let the darkness fade away
And you, you gotta feel the same
Let the fire burn
Just as long as I am there
I'll be there in your night
I'll be there when the
condition's right
And I don't need to
Call you up and say
I've changed
You should stay
You should stay tonight
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
When you don't know how to feel
When you're looking for some love
And you gotta feel the same
'Cause I don't need to
Call you up and say
I've changed
You should stay
You should stay tonight
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
I feel the same
Don't you know it's gonna be alrigh
